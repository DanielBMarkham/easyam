When keeping information in a program, many times we use relational databases. When we normalize the database we ensure we only store the minimum amount of information necessary for the job and there is no duplication.

I teach folks how to develop and maintain backlogs, ordered queues of discussions to have in order to make stuff that people want. This is easy when it's just a small group, but it can grow quickly out of control. In many places, there are these online tools where people waste a lot of time filling out forms and generating documentation instead of getting valuable work done.

But you have to have some kind of system for organizing information.

So here's the question: how do you keep the minimum amount of information necessary so that it has the maximum impact? How do you "normalize" information about the work you do?

EasyAM answers that question.

I teach a simple tagging system for all project information, from customer experiences to production bugs. Once you learn this tagging system, you store this information in text files. Keep them on Dropbox, check them into GitHub. Treat your project information the same way you treat your code.

And just like your code, once notes are checked in, easyam runs and organizes whatever you've entered into a standard format. It's a compiler for organization information. You hook it up in a pipeline and collect information where conversations happen and the deliver it to where the information is needed. The default app will generate gherkin feature files for ATDD, story cards, master question lists, test cases, project backlogs, and program portfolios.

If you want to track stuff, you put it in. If you don't, you don't put it in. Like any other compiler, you run it as needed and pipe things to where you want them to go. It's continuous information delivery. DevOps for organization information.

Information Ops.
